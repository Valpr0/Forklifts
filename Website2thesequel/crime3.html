              <p class="crime-info"> In North Sacramento, California, police are investigating an attempted ATM theft involving two suspects who used a forklift at a Safe Credit Union drive-thru. Surveillance footage shows one suspect driving the forklift into the ATM, toppling it over, and attempting to load it onto a pickup truck. During their escape, the ATM fell from the truck onto a busy street, causing a traffic accident. Both suspects fled the scene and remain unidentified.

                This incident is part of a series of brazen ATM theft attempts across the U.S. In Massachusetts, two men used a chain and pickup truck to try to steal a Bank of America ATM but abandoned the effort and escaped police. In Philadelphia, a stolen U-Haul was used to rip an ATM from a grocery store. While these thefts caused significant property damage, the suspects in these cases did not successfully steal cash. Authorities are investigating these incidents, highlighting the growing trend of bold ATM robbery attempts.
