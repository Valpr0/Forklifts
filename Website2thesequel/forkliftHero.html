              <p class="crime-info">
                In Akron, Ohio, employees at Arlington Autowrecking devised an unusual way to prevent a repeat offender from escaping after allegedly breaking into one of their cars. According to police body camera footage, the employees used a forklift to lift the vehicle, with the suspect still inside, about 20 feet into the air. They explained to officers that this was not the first time the man, identified as 26-year-old Alexander Funk, had broken into their property. Frustrated by his repeated intrusions, they decided to take matters into their own hands while waiting for law enforcement to arrive.
                When officers reached the scene, they found the situation fully under control, leading to a quick and straightforward arrest. Funk was charged with criminal trespassing and possessing criminal tools. Employees recounted previous encounters with Funk, including one instance where he shoved a worker while trying to flee. This incident marked another escalation in the ongoing issues the auto shop faced with theft and break-ins.
