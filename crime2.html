                A 12-year-old boy in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was apprehended after stealing a massive construction forklift and leading authorities on a slow-speed chase that resulted in damage to 10 parked vehicles. The incident began on the evening of Saturday, November 25, when police were called to Forsythe Middle School regarding a report of a stolen vehicle. Upon investigation, officers discovered the vehicle, a Construction Genie GTH-636 Telehandler, being driven south on Brooks Street near Pearl Street. This industrial forklift, weighing up to 35,000 pounds, had been unlocked with its key hidden inside the cab.

Officers pursued the boy as he navigated through the Georgetown Boulevard neighborhood at speeds of approximately 15 to 20 mph. During the pursuit, the forklift struck about 10 parked cars, causing significant damage. Police eventually called off their pursuit when the boy drove north on Nixon Road and crossed the M-14 Bridge due to the potential risks involved. The chase was then taken over by the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office.

The boy finally stopped the forklift near M-14 and Gotfredson Road shortly before 8 p.m., where he was taken into custody without further incident. He was later transported to a juvenile detention center. Police described the situation as extremely hazardous, noting the potential for severe injuries or worse. An investigation into the incident is ongoing, with authorities emphasizing the seriousness of the boy’s actions and the resulting damages.</p>
