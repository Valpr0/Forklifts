              <p class="crime-info"> According to CBS news, protests erupted over the store’s decision to remain open and allegations that Stanback had not been properly trained. At least 11 individuals, including three of Stanback’s siblings, now face various charges for their actions during these demonstrations. On July 22, a group of protesters entered the store, allegedly yelling, throwing items, and refusing to leave despite requests from staff. Seven people were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing, with one individual also accused of damaging store property by knocking over a computer.

                The following day, two protesters allegedly forced entry into the store by breaking a door and were subsequently charged. Another incident on July 28 led to charges of third-degree riot and fifth-degree assault against two men accused of attacking a Menards employee during a protest outside the store. Stanback’s family maintains that their protests were intended to demand answers about the accident and challenge the store’s decision to stay open, not to incite violence. Meanwhile, Menards issued a statement expressing condolences for the loss, and OSHA fined the company $25,000 for safety violations tied to the incident.
