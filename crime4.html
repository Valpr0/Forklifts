              <p class="crime-info">
                In Waldorf, Maryland, a man identified as Bryce Caleb Timothy Brown, 20, allegedly committed a series of crimes involving burglary, vehicle theft, and murder. Authorities claim Brown broke into a Lowe’s store, stole a forklift, and drove it to a nearby Home Depot parking lot. There, he rammed the forklift into a car where 73-year-old Gloristine Pinkney was sleeping. Pinkney attempted to flee on foot, but Brown allegedly chased her and fatally ran her over with the forklift.

Afterward, Brown reportedly stole Pinkney’s vehicle and fled the scene. Deputies responding to the burglary and theft at Lowe’s found Pinkney’s body under the forklift in the Home Depot parking lot. Investigators confirmed that Brown and Pinkney did not know each other and have not identified a motive for the crime. Brown was arrested later that day near his home, where authorities also recovered Pinkney’s stolen car. He faces charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, assault, and theft and is being held without bond.
